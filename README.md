These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

Follow the instructions on [this](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/Installing_Plugins#Copying_the_plugin_to_the_GIMP_plugin_directory) page for plugin installation.

* GIMP plug-ins repositories helped me understanding basic mechanics of the software.
