**This project is not affiliated to WhatsAppÂ® in any way and the code is under the GNU Public License**

WhatsApp Sticker documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/WhatsApp/stickers).

### Prerequisites

Install [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).

### Installing

Download the [plugin](/WhatsappStickerFormat.py) and follow the instructions on [this](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/Installing_Plugins#Copying_the_plugin_to_the_GIMP_plugin_directory) page for plugin installation.

_Note that in Windows and probably in other OS as well, there is no difference between putting the plugin inside the folder "plug-ins" from the installation folder or from the home/appdata folder of the user. Just don't put the plugin inside both because there will be name conflicts._

## Tests

Try the plugin by opening GIMP and by loading some images in the workspace. To activate the plugin you should navigate to File __>__ Export All __>__ WhatsApp __>__ Export all images as WhatsApp Stickers WebP

## Built With

A generic text editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org).

## Acknowledgments

* Got inspired by my frustration on editing with multiple images at once. Existing plugins didn't automate exporting and exporting in WebP in particular.
* GIMP plug-ins repositories helped me understanding basic mechanics of the software.
### Tips
* You can manually launch gimp console version for verbose output on script errors
* You can launch the python interpreter embedded in GIMP program files to debug the syntax of your script
